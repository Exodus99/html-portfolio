<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>With over 12 years of technical experience, I specialize in cloud computing, SaaS platforms, and technical support.
  My background includes working with major cloud providers like AWS and GCP, managing Ubuntu and CentOS servers, and
  troubleshooting complex network issues. Currently, I provide technical support at Viz.ai, where I help optimize
  AI-driven medical imaging solutions that improve patient care.</p>

<p>My journey has taken me through roles that demand a deep understanding of infrastructure, security, and customer
  service. From managing big data analytics tools like Splunk and Grafana to ensuring seamless on-prem and cloud-based
  network operations, I have developed a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset. My experience with Kubernetes,
  Terraform, and multi-cloud architectures allows me to build and maintain resilient systems.</p>

<p>Beyond technology, I am dedicated to leadership and mentorship. Whether it's composing performance reviews to
  recognize my colleagues' contributions or helping others grow in their careers, I believe in fostering a collaborative
  and supportive environment. Outside of work, my family is my greatest priority. My wife is an incredible mother, and
  we are both committed to providing a loving and faithful home for our daughter. My faith and values guide me in every
  aspect of my life, and I strive to grow both professionally and personally.</p>
